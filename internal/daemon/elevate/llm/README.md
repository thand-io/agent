Here is how the role creation process works:

1. **Input Gathering**: The system collects details about the user's access needs, including the specific provider(s) they need to access, the duration of access, and the rationale behind the request.

2. **Permissions / Roles Identification**: The system identifies the necessary permissions and roles required to fulfill the user's request while adhering to the principle of least privilege.

3. **Role Creation**: Lookup the identified permissions and roles in the provider's documentation and return the valid roles and permissions.
